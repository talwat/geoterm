> This project is in an extremely early stage and completely non-functional.

geoterm is, first and foremost, geoguessr: calculator edition. That's pretty much it.

As a secondary goal, there should also be a rudimentary terminal client that can be used
to play on PC.

## Plans/Specifics

* OCR in multiple languages to accompany lower quality image data.
* 4-bit color at 320x240 for the calculator screen.
* Black & white guesser window with simple world map.
