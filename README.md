geoterm is, first and foremost, geoguessr: terminal edition. That's pretty much it.

As a secondary goal, there should also be a rudimentary serial client that can be used
to play on effectively any serial device with a little work, like a gameboy or calculator.

## Plans

* Varied levels of image quality for different devices.
* OCR in multiple languages to accompany lower quality image data.
* Simple lobby/start system
